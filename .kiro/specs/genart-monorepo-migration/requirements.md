# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the migration of creative coding projects into a unified Nx monorepo called `genart-monorepo`. The goal is to consolidate multiple generative art projects while maintaining their individual deployability and enabling code reuse through shared libraries.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manage multiple creative coding projects in a single repository, so that I can share common patterns and maintain consistency across projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the monorepo is created THEN it SHALL contain both `duo-chrome` and `crude-collage-painter` as separate applications
2. WHEN each application is built THEN it SHALL produce independent, deployable artifacts
3. WHEN shared code is identified THEN it SHALL be extractable into reusable libraries
4. WHEN new creative coding projects are added THEN they SHALL follow consistent patterns and tooling

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to preserve the git history of existing projects, so that I don't lose development context and commit history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN projects are migrated THEN their git history SHALL be preserved using git subtree or similar techniques
2. WHEN viewing project history THEN commit messages and authorship SHALL remain intact
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the original repositories SHALL remain as reference but be marked as archived

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want each project to maintain its current build and development workflow, so that existing functionality is not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `duo-chrome` is migrated THEN it SHALL continue to use Vite with the same configuration
2. WHEN `crude-collage-painter` is migrated THEN it SHALL maintain its existing build system
3. WHEN running development servers THEN each project SHALL use different ports automatically
4. WHEN building for production THEN each project SHALL generate separate deployable outputs

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify and extract common patterns into shared libraries, so that I can reduce code duplication and improve maintainability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing both projects THEN common patterns SHALL be identified (p5.js setup, image handling, color utilities, etc.)
2. WHEN shared libraries are created THEN they SHALL be consumable by multiple applications
3. WHEN shared code is updated THEN dependent applications SHALL be able to update incrementally
4. WHEN new projects are added THEN they SHALL be able to leverage existing shared libraries

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent tooling and development experience across all projects, so that context switching between projects is seamless.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN working on any project THEN the same code quality tools SHALL be available (ESLint, StandardJS, etc.)
2. WHEN running commands THEN Nx SHALL provide consistent task execution across projects
3. WHEN adding dependencies THEN package management SHALL be unified at the monorepo level
4. WHEN deploying projects THEN each SHALL have clear, documented deployment processes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the monorepo structure to be scalable and maintainable, so that I can easily add new creative coding projects in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the monorepo is structured THEN it SHALL follow Nx best practices for organization
2. WHEN new applications are added THEN they SHALL follow established patterns and conventions
3. WHEN the monorepo grows THEN build times SHALL remain reasonable through caching and affected project detection
4. WHEN documentation is needed THEN it SHALL be clear how to add new projects and use shared libraries
